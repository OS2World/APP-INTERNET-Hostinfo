This is the OS/2 port of hostinfo 2.2, a simple program to retrieve host information from
an URL/IP address.

Usage is as simple as calling it with a hostname: it should return the IP associated and
its aliases, if any.

I built it with GCC 4.52, so you must have the relative DLLs on your system to use it.

Use this program at your own risk (I tried it some times without problems, but I can't give
any warranty about its use).

Please feel free to email me for suggestions or any other kind of feedback.
