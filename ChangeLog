	* Makefile: Bumped version to 2.2.

	* hostinfo.c: Added '--print-only' option for converting between IP
	address formats (hex/octal/decimal) without performing a lookup. 
	Minor adjustments to help text.  Added a few undocumented
	alternatives for existing command line options.  Significantly
	improved handling of command line syntax errors, so that (1)
	hostinfo halts when it encounters conflicting options, and (2)
	hostinfo prints error messages for all syntax errors it encounters.

	* hostinfo.spec.in: Added ChangeLog to %%files.

	* Makefile: Added autogeneration of changelog using cvs2cl.

	* Makefile, hostinfo.c: Changed method of displaying info for hosts
	with multiple addresses; instead of printing one record with
	multiple addresses, print multiple records, each with a single
	address.  Use spaces to separate multiple aliases, not commas
	(better for autogenerating /etc/hosts-type file).  Use tabs to
	separate -a/-n/-l elements, not spaces, for the same reason.  Added
	-1 option for printing only first address of hosts with multiple
	addresses.  Added note to help about multiple addresses.  Bumped
	version to 2.1.

	* hostinfo.c: Typo in builtin help.

	* Jamfile, Makefile, hostinfo.c, hostinfo.spec, hostinfo.spec.in:
	Major overhaul.  Command line got plenty of new options. 
	Rearranged order of fields when printing full host info.  Added
	capabilities for both printing and interpreting addresses in hex
	and octal as well as decimal.  Added address/name/aliases-only
	options.  Got rid of Jamfile for building; we'll use make instead. 
	Process specfile to automagically update version number.  This is
	truly a different program.  Bumped version to 2.0.

	* hostinfo.spec.in: Oops.  Typo in %%files section.  Fixed.

	* hostinfo.c: only print address type if we're debugging.
